I have been thinking a lot about this and there are a number of reasons that I
believe we need a bible MMO. It could change the lives of many - be they
Christians who have never really studied the Bible, or unbelievers who don't
know what the TRUE gospel is.

# Outreach

The obvious first answer is outreach. There is a large population of gamers out
there that completely dismiss Christianity as a whole because the traditional
teachings don't make any sense. 

This is primarily the reason WE (as [Spirit and
Truth](https://spiritandtruthonline.org/)) should be the ones to create this
game. So many people out there have never heard the unadulterated TRUTH of
scripture. The fact that it actually makes sense if you take out all the extra
baggage that the majority of the churches of today put on it.

With that in mind I would like to make this game sly as a serpent in that we
will call it *__The Book__*. (That's what Bible _means_ after all). The story is
that you, as the player, are sucked into a book and must find your way out by
traveling through the lands it describes. I'll talk more on this later but it
really is an exciting idea!

# Research

Let's face it - reading can get tedious. There is a reason that games are
popular and that is that they are FUN! I have watched my wife help our kids with
their homework enough to know that if you can make learning fun you can do it
for much longer and retain the information much better. If we can port this to
the bible then it will benefit everyone!

Imagine you want to study the wilderness that the Israelites walked through. You
could look through countless Bible Atlases and get some idea of the kind of area
they walked, or you could log in and walk the path __WITH__ them!

# Motivation

Finally I believe the reason it is needed is there is a general lack of
motivation for studying God's Word. Motivating people is one of the major keys
to good games - motivating them to play time and time again. I don't want to
make a game to replace the Bible, but I want to make a game that makes people
want to read the Bible as a strategy guide. 

There are so many intangible benefits to having God's word stored in your heart
that is lost on so many people. If we can only get people to stop and understand
the good that studying can do for their lives... It gives me joy just to think
about it.
